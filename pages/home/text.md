# Hello and welcome to my website

My name is Ivaylo Rusinov, currently a 2nd year MSc student at the University of Groningen and finishing up my Master's thesis that is done in collaboration with the Department of Nephrology at the University Medical Center Groningen (it will be added to the website shortly). I am an aspiring data scientist and software engineer! Aside from my studies, I am a teaching assistant at the university for various courses, both at the Bachelor and the Master level. You can contact me through [Gmail](mailto:ivaylo.russinov@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivaylo-rusinov-7002b2230/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/i4ata). This is my [CV](../../assets/home/cv.pdf).

This website is written using Plotly's [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and is self-hosted on this bad boi (Raspberry Pi 5) at home:

![rpi](../../assets/home/rpi.jpeg)

It is funneled to the web using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). The source code for the website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/i4ata/test) as well as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/i4ata/my_website). Everything keeping the website running other than the Pi itself, its power supply, and its internet connection, is completely free.

The links at the top of this page redirect to some of my passion projects that I work on from time to time alongside my studies. Special attention is paid to ensure that the technicalities of each project are throroughly explained and the source code that runs in the backend is maximally accurate, efficient, and concise. Although the general topics discussed in the projects are technically already known to the world, the implementations, interactions, and explanations  are 100% original. Let me know if you have some ideas on how to improve something!

The majority of the focus during the development of this website is in the quality of the projects and the interactions rather than the design. That is why everything looks so barebones. It will definitely be a project for the future to make everything prettier :)

Tools that I use on a daily basis include: ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/python/python-original.svg#icon)![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/linux/linux-original.svg#icon)![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/azuresqldatabase/azuresqldatabase-original.svg#icon)![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/git/git-original.svg#icon)![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/docker/docker-original.svg#icon)
