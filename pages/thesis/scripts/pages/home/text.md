This is a basic visualization I developed for my Master's thesis. It was originally intended to be a debugging tool for my code but it turned out to be pretty useful. There will soon be a paper about it (hopefully)! Very basically, it is an extension of regular decision trees that incorporates evidence for confounding and causal relationships between the features. It is applied for regression and survival data. More information will be added here soon as well as the interactions.
